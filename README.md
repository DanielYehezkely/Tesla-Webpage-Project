## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes using media queries.
- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: A top navigation bar that remains fixed as the user scrolls.
- **Hero Section**: A large hero image with text and a button to simulate Tesla’s marketing design.
- **Car Models Section**: Static sections showcasing different Tesla models.
- **Footer**: A clean and simple footer with links to Tesla’s social media and services.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
